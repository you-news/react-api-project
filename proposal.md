# YouNews

Created by Roe Cox and Elijah Hawes.

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, YouNews, is designed for users seeking a personalized news source. It allows users keep up with popular news stories, while also letting them browse articles based on topics relevant to the user.

## API & React Router


This application will use the New York Times API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use.

- Link to API documentation: [\[New York Times API\]](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis)
- [Most Viewed Article in Last Week](https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/viewed/1.json?api-key=yourkey)
  - [List of data values used by the endpoint]
- [Article Search](/articlesearch.json?q={query}&fq={filter})
  - [List of data values used by the endpoint]
- [Filter articles by tag](http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept)
  - [List of data values used by the endpoint]



**Example:**
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks
  - This will fetch an array of artwork objects
  - For each artwork, I want the `id`, `title`, and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/{id}
  - This will fetch a single artwork object
  - I will use the `id`, `title`, `short_description`, `medium_display`, `place_of_origin` and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q={query}
  - This will fetch a list of artworks that relate to the search query
  - For each artwork, I will use the `id` and `title`
